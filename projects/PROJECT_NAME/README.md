# YOUR PROJECT NAME
Heart with leds(adjustable effect & brightness)

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
Its just a heart-shaped form pcb with leds with adjustable fade in and fade out effect(i mean, the frequency) and brightness.
Its basically a gift for my parents and a girl i know.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Since Jlcpcb allows you to change the currency i prefer to use reais since it cost less than paying the order using dollars.
The total price is 158.86 reais, 147.97 reais of shipping cost and 10.89 reais of  the cost of 5 PCBs.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Nothing was really complicated, the circuit is very simple although i had the idea of this  project from a circuit i saw in EveryCircuit,
even though its so easy, i think that, one way or another i'd have managed to get it anyway.
